# Cobify Challenge ðŸš•


Cobify has always used SP98 fuel for their cars. Recently, they started using SP95 E10, which is cheaper and more eco-friendly because it approximately contains a 10% ethanol. However, being eco-friendly might be worse for the company and the planed since it has been observed that cars that use SP95 E10 consume more fuel.

This report aims to test this hypothesis based on a data analysis.


## Input data:


Our input data consists of a .csv that contains the distance (km), the consume (L/100km), the average speed (km/h), the temperature inside the car (Â°C), the temperature outside (Â°C), weather conditions and the gas type. Also, I have added a column named external_temp, which possible values are cold or hot based on the outside and inside temperatures.
A very important reminder is that the prices of the fuel are:

                        SP98	    =    1.459 â‚¬/L
                        SP95 E10    =    1.379 â‚¬/L
